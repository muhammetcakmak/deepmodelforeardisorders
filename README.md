The GitHub repository at contains a series of Python scripts designed for the analysis of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features using various machine learning models. Each script follows a structured approach:‚Äã


We used:
  For textural feature extraction: LBP, Color-Space and GLCM models 
  For Deep Feature extraction, EfficieintNet, ConvNetBase and Inception V3 models 
  For feature selection, LDA and PCA 
  For classification, DT, SVM and LightGBM machine learning models 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Extraction of textural features from images (LBP, GLCM, Color-Space transformation)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic feature extraction with deep learning models (EfficientNet, ConvNetBase, InceptionV3)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Elimination of unnecessary features and reduction of data size with LDA and PCA
4Ô∏è‚É£ Classification process with DT, SVM and LightGBM

üìå As a result:

Textural features enabled the model to perform more detailed analysis.
Deep learning models created strong representative features.
Data was optimized with feature selection and the success of machine learning models was increased.
Models such as LightGBM and SVM were used to achieve the highest classification accuracy.

üöÄ This study combined both traditional textural analysis and deep learning-based feature extraction to create a powerful classification model.
 Techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), or ReliefF are applied to select or reduce features.‚Äã
